# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

The TA Application program is currently capable of showing uses 3 different roles with default assigned. The authentication and authorization are 
implemented, implement basic Email confirmation using SendGrid, Update Navbar is to show the user's role. Added up the file upload function, the Modification and Creation Date is handled. We have created different roles for viewing applications. We added chart for TA to select availiable time.

# Comments to Evaluators:

Hi, Evaluators! We are developing this TA application for students to apply for job positions, we want to make it convenient for every student to apply.

UI/UX choices - We have created a different page for review, and made the application page nice.

# Assignment-Specific Topics

Update the Admin Controller to have two endpoints: EnrollmentTrends and GetEnrollmentData
Create a View that allows the admin to indicate a start and end date and a course and to receive the enrollment data over that period
Use HighCharts to display this information in an informative manner
